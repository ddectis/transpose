## About Transpose

This is a tool which can take in docx song files and render them into a web view. This tool provides the ability to transpose the key of the loaded songs. I built this tool to support the 200+ song book that I've created for the Community Music Hangout (https://goldengatejams.com/). 

## What problem does it solve?

When I put songs into the book, I move them into a key I am comfortable singing in. However, the goal of the Community Music Hangout is to enable anyone / everyone to participate. By adding the capability to change the key of my songs on the fly, I can move songs around to fit the range of different singers.
 
## Usage Info

In order to make use of this project, you should have some number of songs in docx format. The important bit is that the chords are in bold and the lyrics are not. Check the "songs" directory for example files. The HTML parsing will group all of the bold elements together and that's what it checks when doing the transposition. 

## Other info

This is still a work in progress. I welcome any and all feedback!
